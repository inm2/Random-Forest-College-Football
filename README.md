# Random-Forest-College-Football

In the past few months, I became pretty attentive towards college football. My alma matter, the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns, has had it's highest rankings in program history. I wanted to look more into the data from college football teams and understand some of the data that is presented.

Through some of my research, a common focal point is the determination of how to handle different situations on the field. Since football has a high level of complexity and variability, utilizing previous data to inform of future decisions can be crucial towards game-planning.

In this program and any future programs, my focus is to understand some of these situations and understand how play calling can be more informed.

My first program in this series is to create a Random Forest Classifier to look at some of the most important factors that are involved with passing, running, or punting the football when an offense is on the field.
