    "# Random Forest Classifier - College Football\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past few months, I became pretty attentive towards college football. My alma matter, the Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns, has had it's highest rankings in program history. I wanted to look more into the data from college football teams and understand some of the data that is presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through some of my research, a common focal point is the determination of how to handle different situations on the field. Since football has a high level of complexity and variability, utilizing previous data to inform of future decisions can be crucial towards game-planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this program and any future programs, my focus is to understand some of these situations and understand how play calling can be more informed. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first program in this series is to create a Random Forest Classifier to look at some of the most important factors that are involved with passing, running, or punting the football when an offense is on the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources and Readings\n",
    "For this program, I used the following resources:\n",
    "1. [CollegeFootBallData.com](https://collegefootballdata.com/) This website has a constant running API that updates frequently.\n",
    "2. [Applying Machine Learning to Predict BYU Football Play Success](https://towardsdatascience.com/applying-machine-learning-to-predict-byu-football-play-success-60b57267b78c) Chris Young and the rest of his team made an application to determine what the best play call is for offense, depending on the field situation. \n",
    "3. [Predicting Plays in the NFL](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-sports-analytics/jsa190348) The researchers in this paper developed a method to interpret when play calls should happen based on field situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start the program, I will be importing data from the 2018-2020 seasons. [If you are interested in importing data from the API,](https://gist.github.com/GJMcClintock/29330e26f674d4103c4f7080212a9208) click on the link.  "

    "- Down: The period in which a play happens. In football, offensively, teams are given 4 downs and must gain 10 yards or score, or else forefit possession to the opponent.  \n",
    "- Distance: The distance remaining to reach the 10-yard increment.  \n",
    "- [PPA](https://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/index.php/home/stats/stats-explained/expected-points-and-epa-explained): Predicted points added, or expected points added, is a metric to determine the impact of the play on a score. It is used to calculate the value of each pass and run play.  \n",
    "- Yards_Gained: The amount of yards gained per pass or run.  \n",
    "- Yards_To_Goal: The remaining amount of yards to a touchdown.  \n",

    "1. Extract the features from the dataframe.  \n",

    "While the accuracy of the model is around 75%, adding more features to the model, such as the opponent's defensive scheme, may help with it's accuracy. Since random forests can be viewed in terms of its inputs and outputs, and not each individual interal function or relationship, in a game like football, would having more control over the inputs would be better in the long term? For example, if I wanted to look at historical 4th down situations, would I be able to classify what's the better option to run or pass the football? In the future, I want to go more in depth and try to answer questions like this. "
